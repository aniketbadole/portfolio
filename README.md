## Portfolio Website

Hi, I am Aniket Badole. I am a full stack developer. This is the project directory for my portfolio website. This project can be accessed from [here](https://aniketbadole.com)

### Programming Languages, Frameworks and Libraries

This portfolio website was built using JSX, HTML and CSS. React was the choice of framework I used since I am very familiar with it, and I love it! Other technologies that I have used in making this project are: gitconnected API to create a user api. Axios to fetch the api data onto the website. social-media-icons-react, a NPM package for React to import and customise social media icons (you'll find them in the footer section).

### Hosting

This website is hosted on `Netlify`. A custom DNS has been added to route the netlify address to the custom domain name.
